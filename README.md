--------------------------------

## Roadmap


 [ ] publish a zip artifact to install manually
 [ ] publish a crx file to install
 [ ] publish to chrome webstore
 [X] add ability to define 'links' to appear next to each job. (some places have tools that integrate with jenkins and it would be nice to jump right to them)
